# SMB-Downloader

SMB-Downloader is a simple Bash script that automates the process of downloading files from shared directories over SMB/CIFS protocol. The tool is designed to interact with remote SMB shares and download their contents to a local directory.

- **Colorful Output**: Uses color-coded terminal output to provide clear information about the download process.
- **Pre-check for smbclient**: Ensures that `smbclient` is installed before execution, preventing errors if the tool is missing.
- **User-friendly**: Simple to use with a clear usage message when arguments are incorrect.
